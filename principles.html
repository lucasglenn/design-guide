          <!-- Consistency section-->
          <h2 class="sub-header">1. Consistency</h2>		  
          <img class="img-responsive" src="images/principles/consistency.png" alt="" width="360">
          <h5>Appearance</h5>
          <p>Across platforms and windows of all sizes, elements must remain as similar as possible as to not interrupt or hinder the user experience. Keeping things like placement, proportions, and elements the same makes interactions seamless.</p>
          <h5>Behaviour</h5>
          <p>The interface and its elements should have consistent behaviours across all platforms to facilitate a stress-free and successful experience for the user.</p>
          <h5>Language</h5>
          <p>A successful interface is not just consistent internally, but is also consistent with the user's experiences of other products as well.</p>
		  <p>Consider your user personas' tech fluency during design and development phases. An interface suited to your common-denominator user will result in stress-free use.</p>
          <p><em>The interface must be consistent and coherent to ensure for the following four principles can follow</em></p>
          <!-- Percievability Section -->
          <h2 class="sub-header">2. Perceivability</h2>		  
          <img class="img-responsive" src="images/principles/perceivability.png" alt="" width="360">
          <h5>Visibility</h5>
          <p>Avoid creating hidden interactions, as the user should not have to guess or search for functions. Create a visual hierarchy that compliments the user's needs. The most important interactions should be the most prominent.</p>
          <h5>Cognitive Load</h5>
          <p>If there are too many choices, decisions, options the user can get frustrated and be unsure of which one is the "right" choice.</p>
          <h5>Friction</h5>
          <p>Breaking information and actions into bite-sized pieces is often better than trying to do the same thing in fewer steps.  If each step is too stressful, it can be exhausting and result in a poor overall experience.</p>
		  <p>If there is an important step that must be understood before continuing, it may be worthwhile to slow the pace down and make sure the user understands before moving on</p>
          <h5>Hints and Signifiers</h5>
          <p>Helpful hints and indicators can assist users in interacting seamlessly. This can be as simple as having a higher contrast colour for hyperlinks.</p>
          <h5>Location and Wayfinding</h5>
          <p>Don't let the user get lost. Show where they are, where they came from, and they will know where they can go.</p>
          <!-- Predictability Section -->
          <h2 class="sub-header">3. Predictability</h2>		  
          <img class="img-responsive" src="images/principles/predictability.png" alt="" width="360">
          <h5>Expectations</h5>
          <p>If we do our job right, the user's expectations will align with their interactions. For a positive experience, a user should expect what will happen before an interaction occurs. User testing is a great way to refine alignment with user expectations.</p>
          <h5>Opportunities</h5>
          <p>Consider all of the opportunities that a user has to interact, each opportunity and subsequent interaction must be perceivable, meaningful, or predictable. Otherwise the result is trial, error, and failure to progress and interact successfully.</p>
          <!-- Feedback-Rich Section -->
          <h2 class="sub-header">4. Feedback-Rich</h2>
		  <img class="img-responsive" src="images/principles/feedback.png" alt="" width="360">
          <h5>Feedback</h5>
          <p>Feedback informs and acknowledges interactions, facilitating a positive, linear workflow. Feedback should not interrupt, but compliment the experience.</p>
          <h5>Reward or Pay-off</h5>
          <p>Once a user has invested a significant amount of effort into an experience it is important to reward them with a pay-off or celebration. This can give them a break from the flow and/or provide a chance to feel good about their investment and get ready to keep going.</p>
          <h5>Error States</h5>
          <p>When something goes awry, whether it be the fault of the server or the client, feedback is critical. Let the user know what went wrong, why, and how to fix it. Refer to the "Error States" section for more direction</p>
          <h5>Reduce Latency</h5>
          <p>Our user's time is important, so don't make them wait. Avoid delays in behaviour and feedback.</p>
          	<!-- Feedback-Rich Section -->
          <h2 class="sub-header">5. Learnability</h2>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="images/principles/learnability.png" alt="" width="300">
          <h5>Workflow Pacing</h5>
          <p>For a quickly learned/repeatable experience, a user should be lead through the experience in a smooth, logical way that feels like there is a manageable goal. Each action should feel like a step closer to completion.</p>
          <h5>Simplicity and Intuition</h5>
          <p>The more simple and intuitive your UI, the easier it is to remember your interactions and workflow patterns. </p>
          <h5>Efficiency</h5>
          <p>It's all well and good for things to be efficient on the server side, but interactions must be efficient for the user first for productive outcomes. Providing good default settings, keeping things simple, and refining workflow patterns are great ways to do this, and they show respect for your user</p>
          <!-- Reward Section -->
          <h2 class="sub-header">6. Reward</h2>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="images/principles/reward.png" alt="" width="300">
          <h5>Reward or Pay-off</h5>
          <p>As mentioned in the feedback section: Once a user has invested a significant amount of effort into an experience it is important to reward them with a pay-off or celebration. This can give them a break from the flow and/or provide a chance to feel good about their investment and get ready to keep going.</p>
